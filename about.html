		I am an outgoing and motivated individual who values honesty, loyalty, and personal growth. I enjoy connecting with others while also appreciating time alone for reflection and self-improvement. Finding a balance between these two has helped shape my mindset and the way I approach life.
		One of my greatest accomplishments is earning my degree and later returning to school to pursue a bachelor’s degree in psychology. This decision reflects my strong interest in understanding people, behavior, and problem-solving. I consider myself patient and thoughtful, often taking time 
		to understand situations before responding. These qualities support both my academic goals and my personal relationships.
		My hobbies play an important role in my personal growth. Gardening is especially meaningful to me because it has taught me patience, consistency, and the value of steady effort over time. It reminds me that growth does not happen instantly and that progress requires care and commitment.
		I also enjoy cooking, which allows me to try new things and express creativity. In addition, 
		I enjoy traveling, discovering new places, and experiencing new environments, which helps me stay open-minded and adaptable.
		Family is a central part of my life and provides constant motivation. Earlier in my life, I faced challenges as a single mother while continuing my education. Managing financial responsibilities while raising a child required resilience, determination, and strong time-management skills.
		 These experiences shaped my work ethic and personal strength.
		Currently, my goals focus on becoming more organized at home, at work, and within myself. Overall, my story reflects perseverance and purpose, guided by a clear message: be yourself, follow your own path, and continue working toward your goals.
